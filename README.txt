This program was made to illustrate OOP principles and design using Java.
This program was made for CS202 for the Winter 2016 term at PSU. 



Program Abstract:
	- An Airbnb-like application in Java that is used to illustrate OOP principles
	and dynamic binding specifically. Additionally, the program features an AVL tree
	for the data structure of locations that are available for rent. The program does
	not make use of a calendar and the capacity for making reservations is limited as
	the focus of the program was to use OOP principles. For a more detailed description
	of the program see the bitBNB.pdf documentation. 

Using the Program:
Run the 'make' command, then "java Main" and follow the program prompts. Once finished,
run 'make clean' to remove the .class files.
